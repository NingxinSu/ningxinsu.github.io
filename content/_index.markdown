# About me

Ningxin Su is currently a third-year Ph.D. candidate in the [Computer Engineering](https://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/) group, [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.toronto.edu), [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca). She received her M.E. Degree and B.E. Degree from [The University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/) and [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/) in 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Ningxin loves dancing, singing and travelling. She thinks the museum is the best place to learn the history of a city, so one of her life goals is to visit as many museums as possible. Because of the pandemic of COVID-19, she changed her goal to visiting beautiful natural scenery. Her research interests focus on federated learning, specifically, asynchronous federated learning and federated unlearning.
