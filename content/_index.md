Introducing Ningxin -- a versatile individual with a passion for the arts and a thirst for knowledge. From conducting in a large choir, to drumming in a rock band, and teaching dance, she is a true lover of music and movement. But her interests don't stop there -- she's also an avid traveler, always seeking out new museums to explore and beautiful natural landscapes to take in. More importantly, she is a researcher in the field of federated learning, with a particular focus on asynchronous methods and federated unlearning. Whether it's on stage or in the lab, Ningxin is always pushing herself to learn and grow.
