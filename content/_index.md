**At a Glance**  

Ningxin Su is currently a third-year Ph.D. student in the [Computer Engineering](https://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/) group, [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.toronto.edu), [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca). She received her M.E. Degree and B.E. Degree from [The University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/) and [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/) in 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Introducing Ningxin -- a versatile individual with a passion for the arts, sports and a thirst for knowledge. From conducting in a large choir, to drumming in a rock band, and teaching dance, she is a true lover of music and movement. Ningxin was also an accomplished long-distance runner, always eager to try new sports. But her interests don't stop there -- she's also an avid traveler, always seeking out new museums to explore and beautiful natural landscapes to take in. More importantly, she is a researcher in the field of federated learning, with a particular focus on asynchronous methods and federated unlearning. Whether it's on stage or in the lab, Ningxin is always pushing herself to learn and grow.
